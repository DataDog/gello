# Gello (test)
_Gello_ is a self-hosted server for managing Trello cards based on GitHub webhook-events.

It is developed by Datadog to help manage community contributions on our open-source GitHub repositories, and incorporate them into our biweekly sprints.

_Gello_ now has support for managing JIRA issues as well.

## How it Works

Users can subscribe Trello boards (and lists) to GitHub repositories through a web UI, and Trello cards will be created to the subscribed list following every Issue or Pull Request opened by a community member.

JIRA projects and parent issues can also be subscribed to GitHub repositories.
 
### Example Usage:

1. Create a new subscription:

2. (A community member) opens an issue:

3. View Trello card or JIRA Issue auto-created from this issue:
